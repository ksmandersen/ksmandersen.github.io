As any good Copenhagen citizen I commute to and from work/university on my bike which adds up to an average 22 km per day (that's 13 miles for you americans). This gives me a great excuse and opportunity to listen to podcasts. I subscribe to a total of 29 podcasts, which seems like a lot but is really not with 10 hours of commute every week.

If you're a iOS/OS X developer this a golden time in the podcast area. There is so much greatly produced content out there. Here I present in descending order the list of my favourite development or technology related podcasts:

**1. [Build Phase](http://podcasts.thoughtbot.com/buildphase)**   
This is my new favourite podcast that I look forward to all week. I listen to it as soon as I get the notification! It is hosted by [Mark Adams](https://twitter.com/21x9) and [Gordon Fontenot](https://twitter.com/GFontenot) who are both Cocoa developers at [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com/). The show sticks to pretty much one topic each week and give great insights into iOS development subjects.


**2. [The Record](http://therecord.co/)**   
Currently in its first season the show is dedicated to tell the story of developers in Seattle before the launch of the iPhone in 2007 and how it changed the development scene. This show has already (now by its 7th episode) many great developers onboard. Each episode a new developer is interviewed about their history in development. This is a great show if for nothing else, nostalgia.

**3. [Debug](http://www.imore.com/debug)**  
Hosted by infamous [Rene Ritche](https://twitter.com/reneritchie) and [Guy English](https://twitter.com/gte) this is another show that interviews cool developers in the Cocoa development community and discuss history and timely topics.

**4. [Edge Cases](http://edgecasesshow.com/)**  
I recently started listening to this show and currently in the processes of listening through the backlog of 80 episodes. In this show [Andrew Pontious](https://twitter.com/apontious) and [Wolf Rentzsch](https://twitter.com/rentzsch) discuss timeless topics in Cocoa development and how to how to solve difficult topics.

**5. [Notification Center](http://www.notificationcenter.tv/)**  
Formed as a casual conversation between [Ash Furrow](https://twitter.com/ashfurrow) and [Top Copley](https://twitter.com/swizzlr) this shows touch on timely topics. The show is very casual end very enjoyable.

**6. [Accidental Tech Podcast](http://atp.fm/)**   
If you haven't heard about ATP by now you must be living under a rock. Staring [John Siracusa](https://twitter.com/siracusa) (long known for [Hypercritical](http://hypercritical.co/)), [Marco Arment](https://twitter.com/marcoarment) (known for [his blog](http://marco.org); formerly of [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com), [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com) and [The Magazine](http://the-magazine.org/)) and [Casey Liss](https://twitter.com/caseyliss) (known for.. [Who the hell is casey?](http://5by5.tv/cmdspace/89)). This show is always a hoot and a half to listen to. Mostly the topics surround Apple and technology but other subjects have included [Software Methodologies](http://atp.fm/episodes/55-dave-who-stinks) and [Sexism in the tech world](http://atp.fm/episodes/57-smorgasbord-of-pronunciation).

**7. [Core Intuition](http://www.coreint.org/)**   
There is something profoundly funny about listening to [Daniel Jalkut](https://twitter.com/danielpunkass) (aKa. Daniel Punkass) ranting about stuff with his buddy [Manton Reece](https://twitter.com/manton). This podcasts mostly covers the world of indie software development and Apple related news.

**8. [Springboard](http://springboardshow.com/)**   
In this podcast [Ash Furrow](https://twitter.com/ashfurrow) (who also co-hosts [Notification Center](http://www.notificationcenter.tv/)) interviews developers in the Mac and iOS community while focusing on new developers entering the field.

**9. [Developing Perspective](http://developingperspective.com/)**  
[David Smith](https://twitter.com/_davidsmith) (aKa. underscore) takes a refreshing look at various topics in developing apps for the iOS platform. Each podcast is under 15 minutes and always gives great food for thought.

**10. [iPhreaks Show](http://iphreaksshow.com/)**   
This podcast is the most recent addition to my many subscriptions and I have only managed to listen to a few episodes so far. This show is also based on interviewing developers and discussing interesting development topics in Cocoa. I can warmly recommend their episodes on [Concurrency with Jeff Kellyey](http://iphreaksshow.com/042-iphreaks-show-concurrency-with-jeff-kelley/) and [64-bit with Mike Ash](http://iphreaksshow.com/024-iphreaks-show-64-bit-with-mike-ash/).
   
Some of these podcasts are very topical and touch on may different and interesting subjects and try to give some insights. Others are interview based where they focus more on the historical aspects of technology and development. Either way I find that each of these shows are definitely worth listening to.

I also listen to some non-development related podcasts and here are my favourite ones:

* [Ad Hoc](http://www.imore.com/adhoc)
* [The Incomparable](http://5by5.tv/incomparable)
* [Mac Power Users](http://5by5.tv/mpu)
* [MacBreak Weekly](http://twit.tv/mbw)
* [This Week In Tech](http://twit.tv/twit)

If you have some suggestions for good podcasts on your own I'd love to [hear about them](http://twitter.com/ksmandersen)! 

For the ones who haven't quite settled on a preferred podcast client you should try [Castro](http://castro.fm). Its elegantly designed, simple and it works every time!.

**Update**   
I’ve gotten a few suggestions from people that I would like to include. [Anders Fogh Eriksen](https://twitter.com/f0gh) recommends [the NSNorth podcast](http://nsnorth.ca/podcast) which I also subscribe to but didn’t make my top 10 list.
