title: Diving into AppCode - Part 1
---

This is the first in a series of posts that explores using AppCode for iOS development. In this post we cover the basics of how to use AppCode. As the series goes on we will cover more advanced topics. This post picks up where I left off in my previous post [The AppCode Resistance](http:/kristian.co/2014/03/31/the-appcode-resistance.html) on the discussion on using AppCode in favor of Xcode.
