title: When an iOS Developer learns Android
---

We as iOS developers tend to be very critical and often times even dismissive of Android as a platform. I am as much guilty of this as anyone else. But often times I wonder what grounds we have for the critique. How can we claim iOS to be a superior platform when only few of us have ever used an Android device for more than a few minutes.

In this semesters course elections I was prompted with the task of filling one of my elective courses. I learned that ITU offers a course named Mobile App Development in which Android development is taught. 

I endorse the competition that Android brings to the market which help to drive the quality of our devices and the software they run foward faster. 

I feel like we sometimes don't give enough credit to Android developers. The platform has matured significantly since its inception.

The reason I hear most developers neglect the android platform is because of the lack of market opportunieties. Even though it is true that android users in average spend less money on apps that users on iOS that is a trend that diminishing with the race to the bottom of app prices in the app store. The question is then if developers neglect the platform because of the market or they're stucking in a dismissive mode.

* Criticism of android
* where do I have my reasons from?
* What we can learn from the other platform
* Not having internal android developers
* grow better collaboration with android developers
* the gap between the platforms are closing in
